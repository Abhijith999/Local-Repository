git remote add origin <-link->
git remote -v -> (to verify remote)
git branch - (to check branch)
git branch -M main - (to rename branch)

Merging Code
way1 - git diff <-branch name-> - to compare commits, branches, files and more
     - git merge <-branch name-> - to merge two branches (for example merging feature1 with main branch)

way2 - creating pull request via github.
Pull Request - it lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on github.

Pull command - git pull origin main - used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content.

Resolving merge conflicts - it is an event takes place when git unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

Undoing changes
case1 - staged changes (add .)
git reset <-file name->
git reset (reset every file)

case2 - commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1

case3 - commited changes (for many commits)
git reset <-commit hash->
git reset --hard <-commit hash->

Fork - a fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility setting with original "upstream" repository.
fork is a rough copy.
